#Principles-of-Big-Data

“Movies” is the theme we chose for analysing the tweets. Based on the data collected from twitter we proposed five varied analytical queries on our theme ‘Movies’. Using this data, the queries are written in Scala which gives analysis on movies where more tweets were done and discussed. The data extracted from queries is displayed in the form of tables. Based on the obtained information we visualize the data in the further phases. Movies use social media for conversations and publicity. Promotion through social media plays a key role in making movie known to most of the people. This large data is holding up to be scrutinized.
